Grupo Frontera No se va Lyrics

So easy it is to fall in love
And so hard to forget you
Because life you swore to me
And today I’m looking for you and you’re not here
Although it hurts me to see your picture
I train my broken heart

In case tomorrow I find you again
I no longer know how to hide
I call and I can’t talk to you
your memory does not go away
It doesn’t go away, it doesn’t go away
Something in you wants to return
And something in me will find you

your memory does not go away
It doesn’t go away, it doesn’t go away
stay again
stay all night
stay again
stay more than 12:00
stay again

that my heart does not forget
Love like this is not forgotten, and it does not go away
It doesn’t go away, it doesn’t go away
stay again
stay for life
stay again
you are my lost bullet

stay again
that my heart does not forget
Love like this is not forgotten, and it does not go away
It doesn’t go away, it doesn’t go away
Border Group
lose my eyes when you dance
Feel a thousand kisses in the air
It was enough to convince me

what if you go
I’ll look for you, even if it sounds crazy
From Bogota to Buenos Aires
How do I explain to you that I don’t know how to forget?
I no longer know how to hide
I love you and I can’t talk to you

your memory does not go away
It doesn’t go away, it doesn’t go away
Something in you wants to return
And something in me will find you
your memory does not go away
It doesn’t go away, it doesn’t go away

stay again
stay all night
stay again
stay more than 12:00
stay again
That my heart does not forget a
Love like this is not forgotten, and it does not go away
It doesn’t go away, it doesn’t go away

stay again
stay for life
stay again
you are my lost bullet
stay again
That my heart does not forget a
Love like this is not forgotten
