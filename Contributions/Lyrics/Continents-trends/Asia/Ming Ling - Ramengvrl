Lyrics of MING LING (feat. Yung Raja) by Ramengvrl.

He be holla' at me 'cause he know I got the yummy
He be on my kitty, pop it open just like Kuaci
Yes, I be salty, you should call me calamari
I am so かわいい, and you just an ani-ani
I'm not Ming Ling (nope), call me "King-Pin" (yeah-yeah)
Even when I'm little, they called me Shen Jing Bing
I'm not Ming Ling (nope), 我有願景 (yeah-yeah)
He wanna pillow-talk, I give 'em the "wink-wink"
Ramen noodle with the spicy (hol' up)
I just took a nap and I woke up to hundred mil
Got these silly hoes hatin' on me (achoo)
They be actin' cold
Now they all up in my show, tryin' to send me samples
Thank God for my talent, thank God for my parents
They told me do better, I gave 'em designer
Your man, he just took a dip
I get why you like that dick
Now he tryin' to wife me
Cuz I got that sweet and sour taste
Bitch, I'm too hot, no Tiger Balm (rrrrr)
I feel like I got the world in my palm (rrrrr)
Eeny meeny miny moe
Man, I can't choose, I want it all
Man, I'm tired of being humble
Tryin' to get wood for my floor
Why they on me?
I don't understand why they be sleepin'
Bitch, it's sunny
Ex-haters always so polite sayin' sorry
Got your dude's DM with his number on my IG
But I only love my money (muachh)
He be holla' at me 'cause he know I got the yummy
He be on my kitty, pop it open just like Kuaci
Yes, I be salty, you should call me calamari
I am so かわいい, and you just an ani-ani
I'm not Ming Ling (nope), call me "King-Pin" (yeah-yeah)
Even when I'm little, they called me Shen Jing Bing
I'm not Ming Ling (nope), 我有願景 (yeah-yeah)
He wanna pillow-talk, I give 'em the "wink-wink"
தோடு on my காது, bling folding up the காசு
Pink stones all on my பல்லு, make ya பொண்ணு do all kinds of things
Linking with Jakarta ting', her விரல் got a வைரம்
She ain't stressing 'cause she with a king
I drip her in designer, Louis V', that's on my trousers
பணம், I'm stacking, it's a mountain
எதிரி hating, that don't work
My வலது கை is a fountain
பன்னண்டு lakhs for my accountant, whoa
This சரக்கு needs to know
She cannot tie me down, it's adiós
I கொலுத்து with my flows, yeah
தமிழன் fella on Vogue, கழுத்து ரொம்ப froze
My வரிகள், billing 'em, give me my கிரீடம்
I need a பெரிய throne, yeah
Ooh, look at my phone
பெரிய சிரிப்பு, pockets are grown
பெரிய கட்டடம், that's for my குழந்தை
குறுக்கே வந்தா gon' turn me to முரடன் gang
916 on me, that's தமிழன் thang
Your பொண்டாட்டி loving the sound of my slang
ஆபரணங்கள்'s on me, flash இது, not a thang
Need me a ராணி at home, not chilling 'til உலகம் knows
Land in plus six-two
ராஜா getting some ramen to go, uh
He be holla' at me 'cause he know I got the yummy
He be on my kitty, pop it open just like Kuaci
Yes, I be salty, you should call me calamari
I am so かわいい, and you just an ani-ani
I'm not Ming Ling (nope), call me "King-Pin" (yeah-yeah)
Even when I'm little, they called me Shen Jing Bing
I'm not Ming Ling (nope), 我有願景 (yeah-yeah)
He wanna pillow-talk, I give 'em the "wink-wink"
